## personal-website
This repository houses the source code for my personal website (https://tylerlowrey.com)

My personal website consists of a mostly static front-end with a React app that is embedded in it. The React app grabs a list of my public github repositories so that they can be displayed on my website. The back-end for grabbing the repositories is its own Spring Boot project that uses Spring Reactive Web, called personal-website-repo-service (https://github.com/tylerlowrey/personal-website-repo-service).
